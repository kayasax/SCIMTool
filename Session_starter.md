## 🛠️ Key Features

**SCIM 2.0 Compliance:**
- Complete CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Microsoft Entra ID provisioning compatible
- ServiceProviderConfig, Schemas, ResourceTypes endpoints
- Proper filtering, pagination, and error handling

**Monitoring & Debugging:**
- Real-time request/response logging
- Searchable log viewer with detailed inspection
- Admin endpoint filtering (hide non-SCIM traffic)
- Performance optimized (<1s load times)

**User Experience:**
- Light/dark theme support
- Upgrade notifications with GitHub integration
- Footer with credits and version info
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop

**DevOps Ready:**
- Docker containerization with proper permissions
- Public Azure Container Registry
- One-click customer updates via PowerShell
- Automated CI/CD with GitHub releases

**Performance Insights:**
- Expected request volume is low; focus on clarity of logs over throughput.
- Lightweight SQLite reduces operational overhead while supporting ad-hoc queries.
- Microsoft docs MCP confirmed Entra request patterns to optimize initial test coverage.
- Removing large text columns from primary list query yields major latency reduction.
- Persisting identifiers removes need to parse bodies repeatedly (final integration pending).
- Potential future improvements: FTS5 virtual table for deep search, cursor pagination, optional gzip.

**Known Constraints:**
- Must stay compliant with Microsoft Entra SCIM validator scenarios.
- Deployment must remain low-cost and easily reproducible for Microsoft engineers (Docker + optional ACA).
- Single-user admin workflow; no RBAC planned for MVP.
- Sensitive payload data retained in logs by design; rely on manual purge for case isolation.
- Rely on Microsoft docs MCP for authoritative SCIM updates; monitor for spec changes.
- Identifier persistence currently best-effort; older rows may lack derived names until backfilled.

- Production-ready containerized deployment
- Customer-friendly update mechanisms
- Enhanced UX with theme support and upgrade notifications
3. Policy changes can render technical solutions obsolete overnight
4. Always validate business assumptions alongside technical implementation
