## 📋 Active Priorities
- [x] ✅ Scaffold backend (NestJS + Prisma with SQLite) and baseline SCIM endpoints
- [x] ✅ Implement request/response logging with manual purge capability
- [x] ✅ Establish Jest + supertest harness (initial Users test)
- [x] ✅ Logs listing endpoint + e2e test
- [x] ✅ Deliver initial React UI (log list + filters + detail modal)
- [x] ✅ Performance tune log list (remove large bodies, derive identifiers separately)
- [ ] 🧪 Expand e2e tests (Groups, filtering edge cases, PATCH semantics, error paths)
- [ ] 🧭 Design Azure Container Registry automation workflow and update-notification strategy (`feature/acr-automation`)
	- [x] ✅ Phase 1: Local version endpoint + remote manifest polling (implemented)
	- [x] ✅ Added CLI upgrade helper (GitHub releases → az containerapp update)
	- [ ] Phase 2: (Deferred) self-update action / managed identity
- [ ] 🏷️ Stabilize persisted `identifier` column (Prisma client / migration alignment + backfill script)
- [ ] 📦 Docker + tunnel usage docs (ngrok / Dev Tunnels) & Azure Container Apps template
- [ ] �️ Optional redaction / masking strategy (configurable)
- [ ] 🔍 Add shallow vs deep search mode + optional FTS plan
- [ ] ⏱️ Cursor pagination (replace COUNT for large datasets)
- [ ] 📚 Finalize external exposure & Entra provisioning guide in README
- [ ] 🔧 Catalogue additional MCP/automation helpers (test data seeding)
- [ ] 🧪 Add health endpoint & diagnostics (latency stats) for admin UI

---

## 🔧 Development Environment
**Common Commands:**
- `npm install` / `npm run start:dev` (backend)
- `npm test` (backend tests)
- `npm run dev` (frontend, once created)
- `docker compose up` (planned local container workflow)

**Key Files:** `api/src/**` (backend), `README.md`, `prisma/schema.prisma` (DB), tests under `api/test`.
**Setup Requirements:** Node.js 20+, npm 10+, Docker Desktop (optional), tunnel tool (Dev Tunnels/ngrok) for external callback tests.
**AI Tools:** Microsoft docs MCP (SCIM reference); additional MCP integrations TBD.

## 🛠️ Key Features

**SCIM 2.0 Compliance:**
- Complete CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Microsoft Entra ID provisioning compatible
- ServiceProviderConfig, Schemas, ResourceTypes endpoints
- Proper filtering, pagination, and error handling

**Monitoring & Debugging:**
- Real-time request/response logging
- Searchable log viewer with detailed inspection
- Admin endpoint filtering (hide non-SCIM traffic)
- Performance optimized (<1s load times)

**User Experience:**
- Light/dark theme support
- Upgrade notifications with GitHub integration
- Footer with credits and version info
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop

**DevOps Ready:**
- Docker containerization with proper permissions
- Public Azure Container Registry
- One-click customer updates via PowerShell
- Automated CI/CD with GitHub releases

**Performance Insights:**
- Expected request volume is low; focus on clarity of logs over throughput.
- Lightweight SQLite reduces operational overhead while supporting ad-hoc queries.
- Microsoft docs MCP confirmed Entra request patterns to optimize initial test coverage.
- Removing large text columns from primary list query yields major latency reduction.
- Persisting identifiers removes need to parse bodies repeatedly (final integration pending).
- Potential future improvements: FTS5 virtual table for deep search, cursor pagination, optional gzip.

**Known Constraints:**
- Must stay compliant with Microsoft Entra SCIM validator scenarios.
- Deployment must remain low-cost and easily reproducible for Microsoft engineers (Docker + optional ACA).
- Single-user admin workflow; no RBAC planned for MVP.
- Sensitive payload data retained in logs by design; rely on manual purge for case isolation.
- Rely on Microsoft docs MCP for authoritative SCIM updates; monitor for spec changes.
- Identifier persistence currently best-effort; older rows may lack derived names until backfilled.

## 💡 Project Insights

**Microsoft Policy Reality:**
- New non-gallery Enterprise Applications have provisioning limitations
- Manual Azure Portal setup required for SCIM configuration
- Technical implementation is complete, policy constraints are external

**Technical Achievement:**
- Full SCIM 2.0 server with monitoring capabilities
- Production-ready containerized deployment
- Customer-friendly update mechanisms
- Enhanced UX with theme support and upgrade notifications
3. Policy changes can render technical solutions obsolete overnight
4. Always validate business assumptions alongside technical implementation
